I have been deep in code generation.
I wanted to share the fruits of my labors.
Without getting into how or why, here is the [documentation](/assets/docs/test_models/test_models/index.html) for my generated code.
Like all good Rust documentation, there are links to the source, if you are so inclined.
I'm especially happy with the generated [doc tests](/assets/docs/test_models/test_models/everything/types/struct.Everything.html#method.new).

The object descriptions from the model make it to the [documentation](/assets/docs/test_models/test_models/one_to_one/types/struct.C.html), what little I wrote.
It's hard to take test models too seriously.
