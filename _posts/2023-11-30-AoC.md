Until this year, I never remember about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) until it's too late.
Never wanting to do things the easy way, I decided to do the 2023 Advent of Code in [dwarf](https://github.com/uberFoo/dwarf).

dwarf is my programming language -- perhaps another sign that I don't do things simply.
It's an offshoot of a larger project that I've been working on for about eight months.
I just recently finished adding `async/await`` support to the language and I was sort of wondering what's next.The best part of this plan is that I'll be adding the solutions as unit tests.
Along with participating in the event, I'll be hardening the language and adding missing features.
Perhaps best of all, this shows that dwarf can be a general purpose programming language.

Expect spoilers, but also expect to get into the guts of an interpreter.
I don't plan on going too deeply into how the interpreter works, but we'll certainly dip our toes.
