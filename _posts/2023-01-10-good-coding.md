Computer programs, in the most basic sense, just transform bits from one shape to another.
Here I take shape to be roughly equivalent to a `type`.

Coding is just making decisions about how they bits are transformed.
Later decisions (code) builds on earlier ones (more code).
The better your early coding decisions are, the better later code that builds upon it will be.
Good decisions are good abstractions.

Good abstractions just somehow appear.
I don't know if it's a built-in ability some people have, or if it's something to be nurtured, and practiced.
Probably some of both, like so much in the world.
There are very few absolutes, and those generally boil down to faith decisions. ðŸ˜‡
